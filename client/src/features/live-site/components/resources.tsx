              If you have attended any hackathons in the past, then you know how much time
              it takes to get a project starteddecide on what to build, pick a programming language,
              pick a web framework, pick a styling framework. A while later, you might have an initial
              project up on GitHub and only then can other team members start contributing.

              The primary focus is on simplicity and ease of use.
              The owner of this project also tried to make it as generic and reusable as possible
              to cover most use cases of hackathon web apps, without being too specific.

            <p>A massive open online course (MOOC) is an online course aimed at unlimited participation
              and open access via the web. In addition to traditional course materials, such as filmed lectures,
              readings, and problem sets, many MOOCs provide interactive courses with user forums or
              social media discussions to support community interactions among students, professors,
              and teaching assistants (TAs), as well as immediate feedback to quick quizzes and assignments.</p>
            <p>MOOCs are great for learning. However, be careful to not submit code from the tutorials/courses.
              MOOCs should be used solely for learning.</p>
