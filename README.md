## Overview

This is the repository for the [MakeUC Website](https://makeuc.io)!

## Getting Started

Note that yarn and a container engine are required for this project.

For a container engine, one of the following is recommended:
- [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) (Recommended)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (Validated)
- [Podman](https://podman.io/) (Untested)

Here are the steps to contributing to the MakeUC Website:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the repository in VSCode
3. Run `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container` in the command pallet in VSCode (`CTRL+SHIFT+P` by default)
4. Using the terminal inside of VSCode, run `yarn dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Contributing

Everyone is welcome to contribute! If you would like more information about the direction of the project, please contact us on the [MakeUC Website](https://makeuc.io/).

### Technology Stack

The following sections layout the notable libraries used in the MakeUC Website.

#### Frontend (Client)

  - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
    - NextJS 13+ is being used with the **app directory**. This is a brand-new and stable feature that differs from normal React applications. Please be familiar with the **app directory** before making contributions.
    - To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:
      - [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
      - [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.
  - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
  - [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)
    - Plugins in use:
      - [PostCSS Import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import#readme)
      - [PostCSS Preset Env](https://github.com/csstools/postcss-plugins/tree/main/plugin-packs/postcss-preset-env#readme)

#### Backend (Server)
  - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - [KeystoneJS](https://keystonejs.com/)
    - [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) is used by KeystoneJS and is the database engine

#### Discord Bot

TODO

### Current Standards

1. Every application file should use TypeScript instead of JavaScript.
2. At this time, no component library is being used. This is due to the very new **app directory** feature in NextJS. At this current time, every major component library does not have proper support for Server Components.
3. Server Components are preferred to Client Components. This allows the majority of the site to be rendered on the server side. Additionally, a "tree" based approach should be used with components, and as such, the Client Components should be the leaf nodes.
4. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is the package manager of choice. 
5. For styling, the following ways are in order of their preference. [Here are the definitions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling).
    - Tailwind CSS
    - CSS Modules
    - Global CSS
    - CSS-in-JS (other methods preferred instead)
6. Use the linting tools and their rules to ensure uniformity. Below is a list of configured linting tools.
    - ESLint
    - Stylelint

## Steps to build the app for Mac and Linux
### Update the following if asked with this command:
* yarn upgrade caniuse-lite browserslist
<br />
To focus on developing the front-end part of your website, you can start the client application separately. This will allow you to work on the front-end without the overhead of running the entire backend and other services simultaneously. Hereâ€™s how you can proceed:
<br />

1.	Start the Client Application:
Run the client development server to see and work on the front-end part of your website.
yarn dev:client

<br/>
Make sure to install yarn as needed.
<br/>
Check for Any Issues:
<br/>
If the client requires the server to be running for API calls, you may need to start the server as well. Start the server in a separate terminal if needed:
<br/>
yarn dev:server

Example of Running Commands in Parallel:
<br/>

Open Two Terminal Windows:

In the first terminal, run the client:

yarn dev:client

In the second terminal, run the server:

yarn dev:server
<br/>
## Summary:
To work on the front-end of your website, start the client application using yarn dev:client. If the front-end depends on the backend APIs, you can start the server in a separate terminal using yarn dev:server. This approach will help you focus on front-end development without the extra overhead of running unnecessary services.
